With this project, I have made a website that is used to book for the "SEA Salon". By integrating various methods such as authpro.com, Google Sites, and google forms, the SEA Salon website is up and running. This was my first ever experience on building a website and I must say it was very intriguing and complicated but overall fun as I got to experiment with various tools and programs. Hopefully, I will be able to expand my knowledge by joining the Compfest 16 Software Engineering Academy. Thank you!
